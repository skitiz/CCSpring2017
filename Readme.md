## The syllabus ##

## Student Evaluation ##

__Exams__
There will be 3 midterm examinations and a final examination. The content will come from the text and other material presented in lecture sessions and recorded lectures. Therefore, class attendance and good note taking are essential tactics for success.
__THERE WILL BE NO MAKEUP EXAMS__. It is the student's responsibility to arrange for an excused absence before the exam. A grade of zero will be assigned for all exams missed without an excused absence. If an emergency arises on the day of a midterm, and the instructor deems that the absence is excused, then the weight of the final exam may be increased to replace the midterm.

__Assignments__
Homework Assignments are due throughout the term. Each of these assignments is weighted as noted in the assessment section below.
__You lose 50% of your score if you turn in a homework assignment late, and late assignments will only be accepted up to 24 hours after the due date.__

There will also be project and presentations.
